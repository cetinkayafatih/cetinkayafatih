### 🧬 Who Am I?
I’m a 22-year-old Industrial Engineering student from Istanbul, blending AI with real-world systems like logistics, production, web technologies, and human emotion. I believe the future belongs to those who build **meaningful systems** — not just functional ones.

### 💡 What I'm Working On
- 📊 [**Industry 5.0 Simulations**](#): Logistics, warehouse, and scheduling solutions powered by AI

### 🧠 Tech I Use
- `Python`, `React`, `Next.js`, `Flutter`, `Tailwind`, `Supabase`
- `Firebase`, `Prisma`, `PostgreSQL`, `Figma`, `LangChain`, `TensorFlow`

### 🌍 My Vision
To become a **New Generation Industrial Engineer** who redefines how we interact with machines, data, and human behavior — not just for automation, but for **meaningful intelligence**.

> "My goal is not to keep up with the world. My goal is to *build* the world."
